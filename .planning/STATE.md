# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-08-07)

**Core value:** Reliable camera-only depth + obstacle awareness and object recognition that makers can run locally and plug into their robots — without proprietary sensors or cloud AI.  
**Current focus:** Phase 2 — Camera Ingest & Live Preview

## Current Position

Phase: 2 (Camera Ingest & Live Preview) — EXECUTING
Plan: 2 of 3
Status: Ready to execute
Last activity: 2026-08-07

Progress: [███████░░░] 67%

## Performance Metrics

**Velocity:**

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table. Recent decisions affecting current work:

- Camera-only depth + obstacles for v1 spatial awareness (not full SLAM)
- Single camera first; multi-cam via extension points
- Web dashboard with live overlays + controls (not chat-first)
- Fixed-class + open-vocab detection
- Perception stream only (no robot control)
- Multi-target: desktop GPU + Jetson/Pi-class edge
- Local OSS models only; stack: FastAPI + YOLO26 + DAV2 Small + React
- Standard granularity: 7 phases
- **Phase 1 package naming:** dist `sentry-ai`, import `sentry_ai`, CLI `sentry` (avoid PyPI `sentry` collision)
- Phase 1 thin deps only: pydantic, pyyaml, typer, pytest, ruff — no torch/opencv/fastapi yet
- [Phase 01]: Dist name sentry-ai (not sentry) to avoid PyPI/getsentry collision
- [Phase 01]: Console script points to main() callable for reliable entry
- [Phase 01]: Apache-2.0 for application code; Wave 0 stubs use pytest.mark.skip
- [Phase 01]: DepthPayload in perception.py with shared validator; StrEnum for ruff UP042
- [Phase 01]: Typed Detection/FreeSpacePayload placeholders; profile YAML via Path + hatch force-include
- [Phase 01]: discover() skip-if-present for entry-point re-declarations of builtins
- [Phase 01]: NullBackend.name = BackendName.CPU; probe_device always available=False
- [Phase 01]: Smoke asserts allow_cloud false before validating synthetic PerceptionFrames
- [Phase ?]: ImageFrame runtime dataclass (meta Frame + image_bgr); Frame stays identity-only
- [Phase ?]: SyntheticSource re-exported from plugins.builtins for entry-point stability
- [Phase ?]: UsbSource/FileSource thin subclasses of OpenCVSource with BUFFERSIZE=1

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

None. Plan check passed with 4 non-blocking warnings (file count per plan, research open-questions labeling, DepthPayload path clarity, depth.kind vs depth_kind naming).
